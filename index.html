I love seeing the big picture mapped out for technology needs. Whether its web development, or the future needs of a department’s wireless technology. Efficiency is huge to me, and I have a passion for finding new and more productive ways to reach goals. Mapping out the technological solutions for the future is an important way to ensure efficiency is reached in every process possible.</i></b></p>

            <p style="color: red;"><b><i>I have learnt what Git and Github is and how to collaborate on Github. Also, Introduction to Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), HTML formatting, HTML tables, list and forms. Finally, Introduction to Cascading style sheet (CSS), cascade hierarchy and CSS properties. <br><br> If HTML were the engine components of a car, CSS would be the body style and the paint job. A website can run without CSS, but it certainly isn’t pretty. CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate. In addition to layout and format, CSS is responsible for font color and more.</i></b></p>

            <p style="color: blue;"><b><i>Padding - The inner space between the content and the border of your box. <br> Border - The perimeter of the box. Borders can be invisible or they could be a thick colored line. <br> Margin - The outer space (or lack of space) surrounding the box. <br><br> The main difference between padding and margin is that padding controls how much breathing room exists within a box, while margin controls how much breathing room or whitespace exists outside of a box. Padding can be set to zero pixels and above. It can change its own element's size and impact how much of a fill color or background image is visible within a box. Margins, on the other hand, are essentially invisible barriers around a box. They define how an element interacts with adjacent elements or the edge of a screen. Margins can be set to zero and above like padding. But unlike padding, margins can also be set to auto and can even have negative values.
